## Key Features:
    * Account Creation
    * Profile Creation
    * Watch Videos that are sorted by Genre


## Development Insights:
    One of the most difficult challenges was giving users the ability to browse through videos. The main challenge was modifying the order of the videos displayed and finding a way to modify state. A solution to this was storing the videos in the component's state and rotating the array anytime the button to shift videos was clicked.
